 **The Titanic Survival dataset** is a widely-used dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis. It contains information about the passengers on board the RMS Titanic, including whether they survived the shipwreck or not. Here is a description of the typical fields you may find in the Titanic Survival dataset:

**Passenger Information**:
This section includes data about the passengers, such as their names, gender, age, and passenger class (First, Second, or Third Class). This information provides insights into the demographics of the passengers on board.

**Ticket Information**:
Ticket information includes details about the passengers' ticket numbers, fares paid, and cabin information. This data can be used to analyze patterns related to ticket prices and cabin locations.

**Travel Details**:
Travel details provide information about the passengers' travel arrangements, such as the port of embarkation (Cherbourg, Queenstown, or Southampton) and the destination of the journey.

**Family Relationships**:
This section includes data about the family relationships of passengers, including the number of siblings/spouses (SibSp) and the number of parents/children (Parch) they were traveling with. These variables can be used to analyze the presence of family groups on board.

**Survival Status**:
The survival status field indicates whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not. This binary variable is typically represented as 1 (survived) or 0 (did not survive). This field serves as the target variable for prediction models.

**Other Relevant Factors:**
Additional fields may be included to capture any other relevant factors that could potentially affect survival rates. These may include variables such as passenger ID, lifeboat numbers (if applicable), and any special circumstances related to the passenger's survival.

The Titanic Survival dataset is often used as a training dataset for classification and predictive modeling tasks. Researchers and data scientists use this dataset to explore patterns and factors that influenced the survival rates of passengers on the Titanic. By analyzing this dataset, one can gain insights into the demographics, socio-economic factors, and strategies for survival during the shipwreck.

**Objective:**
Conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover key patterns and insights related to passenger survival. The project involved analyzing categorical and numerical data, identifying trends, and visualizing the relationships between various factors like age, gender, class, and embarkation location to assess their influence on survival rates.

**Key Highlights:**
Explored and cleaned data by handling missing values and transforming features for analysis.
Visualized key trends such as survival rates across different passenger classes, genders, and ages using bar charts, histograms, and pie charts.
Analyzed the correlation between features like Fare, Age, and Pclass with survival likelihood.
Provided actionable insights on how factors such as socioeconomic status (class), gender, and age influenced the chances of survival on the Titanic.

Successfully Performed **Exploratory data Analysis** to understand the demographic composition of passengers and their survival outcomes.
